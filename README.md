Configuration files for easy syncing between computers for myself and might serve as inspiration for someone else.

### Emacs
* Emacs configuration suitable for a Vim user.
* The intention is to use Emacs as a better Vim using evil mode.
* The configuration should be cross-platform as far as possible (I'm using a combination of Ubuntu, Windows and Mac OS).
* Installation should be automatic to a large degree. Copying the config and starting a vanilla Emacs should be sufficient.
